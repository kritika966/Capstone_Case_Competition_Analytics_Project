### Business Problem Statement
Swire Coca-Cola faces significant operational challenges due to its reliance on reactive maintenance processes, which address machine failures only after they occur. This approach leads to prolonged production downtime, increased operational costs, and financial strain, as well as disruptions in meeting customer demand. The lack of predictive insights into machine performance hinders the company’s ability to proactively schedule maintenance and optimize inventory for repairs.

The company's existing systems, such as the Internal Warehouse Controller (IWC), collect substantial data on machine breakdowns and maintenance activities. However, these data are underutilized in identifying patterns, predicting failures, and planning preventive measures. This gap prevents Swire Coca-Cola from achieving optimal operational efficiency and meeting its production targets.

### Project Objective
The objective of this project is to design and implement a predictive maintenance solution for Swire Coca-Cola. Leveraging the historical data from the IWC system, the project aims to:

Identify patterns and trends in machine breakdowns and their causes.
Forecast future downtimes and potential failures using advanced predictive modeling techniques.
Optimize inventory management by predicting the spare parts required for specific repairs.
Provide actionable insights to improve maintenance scheduling, reduce unplanned downtimes, and enhance machine reliability.
This solution will transition Swire Coca-Cola from a reactive to a predictive maintenance approach, significantly improving operational efficiency, reducing costs, and ensuring consistent production to meet market demand. By achieving these goals, the company can mitigate financial losses, streamline operations, and maintain a competitive edge in the beverage industry.

### Solution

To address Swire Coca-Cola’s maintenance challenges, our team developed a comprehensive predictive maintenance solution aimed at preventing unplanned downtimes and optimizing operations. By analyzing data from the Internal Warehouse Controller (IWC) system, we identified actionable insights and built a framework to support proactive maintenance planning. Here’s how we approached it:

#### **1. Understanding and Preparing the Data**
We began by thoroughly cleaning and organizing the IWC data to ensure accuracy and consistency. This step was crucial for uncovering patterns and creating reliable predictions. Key actions included:
- Standardizing data formats.
- Categorizing maintenance types (e.g., planned vs. unplanned).
- Extracting insights on downtime durations, causes, and machine locations.

#### **2. Finding Key Insights**
Through detailed analysis, we identified patterns and trends in the data. This included:
- Spotting recurring breakdown causes and their frequency.
- Understanding the timing of failures and which machines were most at risk.
- Highlighting the financial and operational impact of downtimes.

#### **3. Building the Predictive Model**
We developed a predictive maintenance model to forecast future downtimes. This model helps anticipate when a machine might fail and identifies which parts are most likely to need repair. The model’s capabilities include:
- Providing actionable predictions about potential failures.
- Estimating the opportunity cost of breakdowns to prioritize fixes.
- Offering insights into preventive measures to reduce downtime.

#### **4. Validating the Model**
Our model was rigorously tested against historical data to ensure accuracy and reliability. Through iterative validation, we refined its predictions and improved its practical applicability.

#### **5. Business Integration**
Our solution seamlessly integrates with Swire Coca-Cola's existing systems, allowing the production and maintenance teams to utilize predictive insights directly within their workflows. The solution empowers the company to:

- Reduce unplanned downtimes by proactively addressing potential failures.
- Optimize spare parts inventory, improving operational efficiency.
- Enhance decision-making regarding production and maintenance strategies.
  
By implementing this predictive maintenance pipeline, Swire Coca-Cola can achieve significant cost savings, improve machine reliability, and close the gap in meeting production targets, thereby enhancing overall operational performance.

This solution not only boosts operational efficiency but also enhances Swire Coca-Cola’s ability to meet market demand, improving profitability and customer satisfaction.

### Difficulties Encountered
Our biggest challenge was dealing with missing data. A large portion of the dataset had gaps, which made it tough to get accurate insights. Cleaning and filling these gaps required a lot of effort and careful consideration to ensure the results were reliable. 

We also faced difficulties managing the complexity and size of the data. Finding meaningful patterns and creating features took time and a lot of back-and-forth to get it right.  

Validating the predictive model was another hurdle. It needed several rounds of testing and adjustments to make sure it was both accurate and practical. 

Finally, working as a team had its initial challenges. With different approaches and ideas, it took time to coordinate and stay aligned, but good communication helped us overcome this. These challenges pushed us to think critically and work collaboratively, ultimately improving the quality of our solution.

### Key Takeaways and Learning Experience

This project was a great learning experience for me. I learned how to handle large datasets with missing values, which helped me understand the importance of data quality and the impact it has on analysis.  

Working on the predictive model taught me how to apply machine learning techniques to real-world problems and refine them through testing and validation.  

I also realized how critical good feature engineering is—transforming raw data into meaningful inputs made a huge difference in the model’s accuracy.  

On a personal level, I improved my problem-solving skills by tackling challenges like missing data and ensuring the model was both reliable and practical.  

Finally, I learned the value of teamwork. Communicating and collaborating effectively with my teammates showed me how different perspectives can lead to better solutions.  

Overall, this project gave me hands-on experience and a better understanding of how data and technology can solve real business problems.
